				Temple Beth Shalom was founded in 1978. Since then we have grown from a handful of individuals to over 500 families. Our building was dedicated in November, 1984.</p>

			<p>
				Our mission is to “Bring Good Things To Light". We believe that God gifts to each of us a divine spark. It is that divine spark that makes each of us who we are as human beings and as Jews. Our challenge throughout our lifetime is to develop a
				healthy relationship with that divine spark. If we succeed then by our actions and our growth “We Bring Good Things to Light.?In other words, we each do our share to inject light into a world that is often far too dark.</p>

			<p>
				Mitzvot are tools of light. The more mitzvoth we do, the more light we bring into our lives and into the lives of those around us. Being part of a “community of light?means that we share in this sacred task together. Being part of TBS gives each of
				us the opportunity to connect with each other, with our history and with our tradition.</p>

			<p>Be part of the TBS experience and together we will “Bring Good Things to Light!?</p>
